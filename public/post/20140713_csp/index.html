  <h1>Study Materials for Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP)</h1>
  <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 13, 2014</span>
      

<p>I have just started to learn about concurrency.
<a href="http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf">Communicating Sequential Processes</a>
is one of the seminal book in this field,
which is more often mentioned than studied.
This is the reason I wish
to write a series of blog posts
about the book,
which mainly served as some kind of reading notes for myself,
and additionally, a summary for those who are interested, and
to lure them into serious study.</p>

<p>Beside the original book,<a href="http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf">Theory and Practice of Concurrency</a>,
a more recent book written by A.W. Roscoe,
also provides a good introduction to the subject.
In the future post,
I will try to write up what I have learned
from reading these 2 book closely.</p>

<p>At the mean time, I have included a few interesting
videos that inspire my study.
The first 1 is the introduction of the
core-async library,
which is an implementation of the CSP,
by Rich Hickey, the creator of clojure.
And the other 2 are the introduction
to concurrency using Go language by
Rob Pike, once of the creator of Go.</p>

<h3 id="toc_0">Actor Model</h3>

<p>Besides CSP, actor model is another
conceptual framework to study concurrency.
In a sense, actor model is more
general than CSP for it is also
a model of computation in general.</p>

<p>Perhaps the best introduction to the actor model
is the paper <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1459.pdf">Actor Model of Computation: Scalable Robust Information Systems</a>
by the creator of the model himself, Carl Hewitt.</p>

<p>For those who enjoy intellectual conversation,
here is a whiteboard session
by Carl Hewitt and Erik Meijer.</p>

<p>Finally, for the comparison of actor model and CSP,
here is a good article.</p>
