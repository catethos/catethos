    Research Methodology is compulsory subject for my study. In the course, the lecturer spoke about ethics, plagiarism, and types of innovation. In particular, I do not agree with her emphasize on the technicalities of research over the spirit of research. I also do not agree with her saying that reinterpretation is the lowest kind of innovation. And hence the following ranting.

    Reflect, Refine, Refactor Today I have read the book &ldquo;Show Your Work&rdquo; by Austin Kleon, the very same author who brought us &ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo;. Following the tradition of his previous book, the author serves us nuggets of advices, One of them that particularly resonates with me is: Become a documentarian of what you do. In the context of exposing yourself to the world, which is the theme of this book, the documentation of your working process serves 2 purposes: By far it is a superior way to showcase your work and your contributions than a traditional resume.
