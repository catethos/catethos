        Study Materials for Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP)
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Jul 13, 2014</span>

    I have just started to learn about concurrency. Communicating Sequential Processes is one of the seminal book in this field, which is more often mentioned than studied. This is the reason I wish to write a series of blog posts about the book, which mainly served as some kind of reading notes for myself, and additionally, a summary for those who are interested, and to lure them into serious study.

    Reflect, Refine, Refactor Today I have read the book &ldquo;Show Your Work&rdquo; by Austin Kleon, the very same author who brought us &ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&rdquo;. Following the tradition of his previous book, the author serves us nuggets of advices, One of them that particularly resonates with me is: Become a documentarian of what you do. In the context of exposing yourself to the world, which is the theme of this book, the documentation of your working process serves 2 purposes: By far it is a superior way to showcase your work and your contributions than a traditional resume.
