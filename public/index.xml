      <title>Research Methodology</title>
      <link>http://catethos.github.io/post/20140726_research_methodology</link>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research Methodology is compulsory subject for my study.
In the course, the lecturer spoke about ethics, plagiarism,
and types of innovation.
In particular, I do not agree with her emphasize on
the technicalities of research over the spirit of research.
I also do not agree with her saying that
reinterpretation is the lowest kind of innovation.
And hence the following ranting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the study of economy,
we have this old maxim:
people response to incentives, and the rest is commentaries.
Indeed, self-interest is the mechanism
behind Adam Smith’s invisible hand,
the axiom of John von Neumann and
Oskar Morgenstern’s game theoretic approach to economy,
as well as the foundation of modern behavioral finance.
Should there is a strand of idea
that weave together all the aspects of research activity,
I believe it must be :
care only for the truth, and the rest is commentaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If all we care about is the truth,
why do we commit plagiarism,
why do we tint our research result,
why do we produce low quality research
and why the issue of trustworthiness is even brought up to the table.
Is it not because we allow our personal ambition,
yearning for approval,
proffessional career,
the pressure to publish and
maybe the prospect of getting more funding
to be placed in front of our care for truth.
No doubt, these are all very real and pragmatic problems
that not any dose of idealism can hope to solve.
However, I wish to address two questions under the light of the care for truth:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What are the basic process of research, study, and thinking in the broadest sense?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what sense the reinterpratation of data contains high originality?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In signal processing,
we use Fourier or wavelet analysis
to break down and understand the complex signal;
in programming,
we break down a complicated specification
into simpler modules only to assemble them into bigger programs later;
in physic, we study the most basic particle in order to build the Grand Unified Theory.
It is the core of scientific method
to analyze a complex phenomena or system by
decomposing it into simpler parts which we know more about,
or at least easier to investigate,
and synthesize our understanding from these parts.
The synthesize process often involving gathering data from different sources,
putting them together to look for patterns and
finally we might gain some knowledge by
incorporating them into a bigger framework
or building a theory to explain them.
Analysis and synthesis are the basic building block of research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we turn our attention to study, take reading for a concrete example. For
the first time when we read a book, we look at its title and flip around to know
whether it is about aerodynamic, baseball, cat grooming, or other topics.
We then go through its table of content to get a sense of its overall organization.
In other word, we analyze the book.
The raw texts are the data to be interpreted and
parsed into the form of information, meaning, facts, an arguments.
As a reader, we have to organize them
in a coherent way to form our own understanding of the book.
This is the synthesis part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is in the sense of our parallel description of research and study that they are
similar. The main difference is the product of synthesis. For research, it is a new
understanding; for study, it is an existing understanding. However, this is a differ-
ence without distinction. If we really care about the truth, our first concern must
be the validity of our own understanding. In other words, we must examine our
own understanding. To examine our own understanding, we must break it apart
and put it back together again, differently. Take the famous equation \(E = mc^2\)
for example, if we only rearrange the equation into \(m = E\) , we have changed our \(c^2\)
perspective from how to make an atomic bomb to the deep theory about the origin of mass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By applying analysis and synhesis to our own understanding,
we might not add anything new to the human knowledge,
but we have changed its shape and all are not the same again.
Thus the reinterpretation of data in the previous sense contains high originality.
In fact, it is the paradigm change that might only explain the same things differently initially,
but at the end, it allow us to see new things that we cannot even begin to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Study Materials for Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP)</title>
      <link>http://catethos.github.io/post/20140713_csp</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 13 Jul 2014 07:25:26 UTC</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I have just started to learn about concurrency.
&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf&#34;&gt;Communicating Sequential Processes&lt;/a&gt;
is one of the seminal book in this field,
which is more often mentioned than studied.
This is the reason I wish
to write a series of blog posts
about the book,
which mainly served as some kind of reading notes for myself,
and additionally, a summary for those who are interested, and
to lure them into serious study.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the original book,&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf&#34;&gt;Theory and Practice of Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;,
a more recent book written by A.W. Roscoe,
also provides a good introduction to the subject.
In the future post,
I will try to write up what I have learned
from reading these 2 book closely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the mean time, I have included a few interesting
videos that inspire my study.
The first 1 is the introduction of the
core-async library,
which is an implementation of the CSP,
by Rich Hickey, the creator of clojure.
And the other 2 are the introduction
to concurrency using Go language by
Rob Pike, once of the creator of Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.infoq.com/presentations/core-async-clojure&#34;&gt;Rich Hickey Video1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Origins of Go Concurrency style by Rob Pike
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/3DtUzH3zoFo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concurrency Is Not Parallelism by Rob Pike
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/cN_DpYBzKso&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Actor Model&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides CSP, actor model is another
conceptual framework to study concurrency.
In a sense, actor model is more
general than CSP for it is also
a model of computation in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the best introduction to the actor model
is the paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1459.pdf&#34;&gt;Actor Model of Computation: Scalable Robust Information Systems&lt;/a&gt;
by the creator of the model himself, Carl Hewitt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who enjoy intellectual conversation,
here is a whiteboard session
by Carl Hewitt and Erik Meijer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything You Want to Know about Actor Model by Hewitt, Meijer and Szyperski
&lt;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/7erJ1DV_Tlo&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, for the comparison of actor model and CSP,
here is a good article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1768317&#34;&gt;A Tale of Two Concurrency Models: Comparing the Go and Erlang Programming Languages&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Reflect, Refine, Refactor</title>
      <link>http://catethos.github.io/post/first</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 11 Jul 2014 08:13:40 UTC</pubDate>

&lt;h2 id=&#34;toc_0&#34;&gt;Reflect, Refine, Refactor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I have read the book &amp;ldquo;Show Your Work&amp;rdquo; by Austin Kleon,
the very same author who brought us &amp;ldquo;Steal Like an Artist&amp;rdquo;.
Following the tradition of his previous book,
the author serves us nuggets of advices,
One of them that particularly
resonates with me is: &lt;em&gt;Become a documentarian of what you do&lt;/em&gt;.
In the context of exposing yourself to the world,
which is the theme of this book,
the documentation of your working process serves 2 purposes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By far it is a superior way to showcase your work
and your contributions than a traditional resume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is also the source of materials that you want to share
with the world in order to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However in this blog post, I am going to focus on its role
in self development, in improving ourselves in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not a secret that writing down our though
will help us to think clearer. Genius like
Leornado Da Vinci left behind tons of notebooks,
full of his casual observations, beautiful sketches,
riddles, meditations and a wide range of other writings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/notebook.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Notebook&#34; title=&#34;Da Vinci&#39;s Notebook&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But perhaps none other than a genius of our time,
Prof. Edsger Wybe Dijkstra, a famous computer scientist,
can illustrate the point better.
In the following video interview, entitled &amp;ldquo;Discipline in Thought&amp;rdquo;,
he mentioned his daily discipline of
writing down clearly his thoughts,
which lead to hundreds of scientific papers
archived in &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/&#34;&gt;EWD Archive&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&#34;420&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; align=&#34;middle&#34;
src=&#34;//www.youtube.com/embed/EL97C8C53ZM&#34; 
frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You think you know when you learn, are more sure when you
can write, even more when you can teach, but certain
when you can program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Alan Perlis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing things down forces us to reflect on our thinking process,
encourages us to refine our logical arguments,
and to further consider some subtleties which
we might miss on the first occasion.
But perhaps more importantly, writing allows us
to look at our thought more objectively because
now it is out there, on a piece of paper, not
inside our head. The new gain objectivity thus allows
us to refine our idea further.
Take programming as an example, writing down a program
require us to gain a fairly good understanding of a problem,
and by refactoring the program our understanding goes
even deeper. Notice that our understanding is spiraling up,
as a effect of constant writing and refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can observe the same pattern in many other different areas.
For example, internal emotional mastery begin with
noticing the inner experiences and to be able to
articulate them in such a way to gain some conscious
control over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Become aware of internal, subjective sub-verbal experiences,
so that these experiences can be brought into the
world of abstraction, of conversation, of naming, etc.,
with the consequence of that it immediately becomes possible
for a certain amount of control to be exerted
over these hither unconscious and uncontrollable processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Abraham Maslow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what education is all about: to be able
to learn, unlearn, and relearn;
to break down our old understanding and
build up a new understanding;
to refactor our thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would define intellectual elegance
as a mind that is continually refine
itself with education and knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Massimo Vignelli&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, this is how we improve our life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At every moment, step by step,
one must confront what one is thinking and what one is doing,
with what one is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;~ Michel Foucalt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
