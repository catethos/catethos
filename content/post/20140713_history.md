>The art of man is able to construct monuments
>far more permanent than the narrow span of
>his own existence; yet these monuments, 
>like himeself, are perishable and frail;
>and, in the boundless annals of time,
>his life and his labours must equally 
>be measured as a fleeting moment.
>
>Edward Gibbon, The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Chap. 71

>Herodotus, from Halicarnassus,
>here displays his enquiries,
>that human achievement may be
>spared the ravage of time.
>And that everything great and
>astounding, and all the glory
>of those exploits which
>served to display Greeks and Barbarians
>alike to such effect, be kept alive -
>and additionally, and most importantly,
>to give the reason they wen to war.
>
>Herodotus, The Histories, Chap.1(Translated by Tom Holland)
