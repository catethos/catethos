title = "Study Materials for Communicating Sequential Processes(CSP)"

+++
I have just started to learn about concurrency.
[Communicating Sequential Processes](http://www.usingcsp.com/cspbook.pdf)
is one of the seminal book in this field,
which is more often mentioned than studied.
This is the reason I wish
to write a series of blog posts
about the book,
which mainly served as some kind of reading notes for myself,
and additionally, a summary for those who are interested, and
to lure them into serious study.

Beside the original book,[Theory and Practice of Concurrency](http://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/bill.roscoe/publications/68b.pdf), 
a more recent book written by A.W. Roscoe,
also provides a good introduction to the subject.
In the future post,
I will try to write up what I have learned
from reading these 2 book closely.

At the mean time, I have included a few interesting 
videos that inspire my study.
The first 1 is the introduction of the
core-async library,
which is an implementation of the CSP,
by Rich Hickey, the creator of clojure.
And the other 2 are the introduction
to concurrency using Go language by 
Rob Pike, once of the creator of Go.

### Actor Model
Besides CSP, actor model is another
conceptual framework to study concurrency.
In a sense, actor model is more
general than CSP for it is also
a model of computation in general.

Perhaps the best introduction to the actor model 
is the paper [Actor Model of Computation: Scalable Robust Information Systems](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1008.1459.pdf)
by the creator of the model himself, Carl Hewitt.

For those who enjoy intellectual conversation,
here is a whiteboard session
by Carl Hewitt and Erik Meijer.

Finally, for the comparison of actor model and CSP,
here is a good article.
